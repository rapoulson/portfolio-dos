This production of Lucy Thurber's Where We're Born, starring Betty Gilpin and Chris Abbott is one of my favorite things I've worked on. As assistant director I supported director Jackson Gay and the creative team both in rehearsals at Rattlestick Playwright's Theater and in residence on Ryder Farm."

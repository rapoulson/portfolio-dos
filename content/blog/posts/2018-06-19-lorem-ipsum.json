  "body": "Collec(tive) is a location based Augmented Reality game that dramatizes the potential impact of personal choices and policy change on the rate of climate change. Players walk around Northwestern's campus harvesting resources and then are faced with the choice of whether to keep those resources in the form of wealth or to invest them in climate change mitigation strategies. Collec(tive) is a multi-team game and as long as the overall state of greenhouse gas emissions don't exceed the threshold set out in the Paris Climate accords, the team with the most wealth at the end of the game wins. However, if teams harvest too much and invest too little, acceptable ghg levels are exceeded and everyone loses.\n\nCollect(ive) was designed to explore Augmented Reality's ability to make global issues feel immediate by reflecting them onto the local environments in which we live. Another aspect of the technology we were interested in exploring is the potential to use AR as a tool to encourage audiences to inhabit the same physical space and start conversations.\n\n![](/images/uploads/collective-gif.gif)\n\nCollect(ive) ran as a project in the Knight Lab Studio class over two quarters during the 2018-2019 school year.
